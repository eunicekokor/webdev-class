Handling events in the DOM. JQuery, JavaScript Fundamentals
We'll be learning nodejs a backend javascript framework.
It's event driven, non-blocking input and output and is built on Chrome v8

Node cares about the fs, process and the net
<scripts> care about windows, history and the document.

Event Driven
	events are added to an event queue and are processed by javascript
		types of events are network connections, timeouts, user ations and I/O
			element.onclick = function(event) {}; //only happens when the event occurs
				Event Loop
						it listens, executes callbacks
							
								example:
									var start = new Date();
										setTimeout(
											var end = new Date();
												console.log(Time elapsed:", end - start, 'ms');
													}, 500);
											
												while (new Date() - start < 1000);
													//event starts running until after 500 seconds
Non-blocking I/O
what?
	whenever you want something that's not from the node process itself, node is going to go do taht other thing and then come back and create an event and handle it that way
		analogy: a kitchen w/ one chef
			
			IF you have a blocking I/O, it's like you go to a grocery store and ask for the price and it holds up the line, so there are multiple lines for other customers to go through if they don't wanna wait
			Node hands it like a mater dei at a restaraunt.it will let you know when it's done.
			Blocking vs Non-blocking I/O

			nonblocking callback funct
			//do something asynchronously
			db.fetch(expensive_query, function(results) {
					results.forEach(function(result) {
								console.log(result);
									});
			});

			consolte.log("yay!");
			**in non-blocking, YAY will print out before RESULT**

			blocking callback funct
			//while we're doing DB request the js engine just stops and waits
			results.forEach(function(Result {
					console.log(result);
			});
			console.log(" yay!");
			**in blocking RESULT will print out before YAY**

			Asynchronous Programming

				Flow controls
					task: load files from a directory: 
							the synchronous way to load files is not good for high concurrency applications
								
										var fs = require("fs")
												
														fs.readdir(
																async.js is the most popular libary in node for working with asynchronous code. handles recursions, bookkeeping of callbacks, 
																		
																				done is a function given by asynch library
																						
																								readFile is asynch because it's slow and has to call an outside thing
																										
																											Promises

																											Node Package Manager and npm

																											Require #Modules
																												var hello = require('./hello.js');
																													
																														it's a way to namespace/modularize your code
																															same scope! vars inside a file are local to that file (function scope_
																																var hello = require("./hello.js');
																																	Node wraps every JS file
																																		var exports = {};
																																			var module.
																																				built in libraries - fs, http, net,
																																					
																																					JavaScript Scopes: function creates scopes

Handling events in the DOM. JQuery, JavaScript Fundamentals
We'll be learning nodejs a backend javascript framework.
It's event driven, non-blocking input and output and is built on Chrome v8

Node cares about the fs, process and the net
<scripts> care about windows, history and the document.

Event Driven
	events are added to an event queue and are processed by javascript
	types of events are network connections, timeouts, user ations and I/O
	element.onclick = function(event) {}; //only happens when the event occurs
	Event Loop
		it listens, executes callbacks
							
		example:
		var start = new Date();
		setTimeout(
			var end = new Date();
			console.log(Time elapsed:", end - start, 'ms');
			}, 500);
											
		while (new Date() - start < 1000);
		//event starts running until after 500 seconds
		
Non-blocking I/O
what?
	whenever you want something that's not from the node process itself, node is going to go do taht other thing and then come back and create an event and handle it that way
		analogy: a kitchen w/ one chef
			
			IF you have a blocking I/O, it's like you go to a grocery store and ask for the price and it holds up the line, so there are multiple lines for other customers to go through if they don't wanna wait
			Node hands it like a mater dei at a restaraunt.it will let you know when it's done.
			Blocking vs Non-blocking I/O

			nonblocking callback funct
			//do something asynchronously
			db.fetch(expensive_query, function(results) {
					results.forEach(function(result) {
								console.log(result);
									});
			});

			consolte.log("yay!");
			**in non-blocking, YAY will print out before RESULT**

			blocking callback funct
			//while we're doing DB request the js engine just stops and waits
			results.forEach(function(Result {
					console.log(result);
			});
			console.log(" yay!");
			**in blocking RESULT will print out before YAY**

			Asynchronous Programming

			Flow controls
			task: load files from a directory: 
			the synchronous way to load files is not good for high concurrency applications
			var fs = require("fs")
			fs.readdir(
			async.js is the most popular libary in node for working with asynchronous code. handles recursions, bookkeeping of callbacks, 
			done is a function given by asynch library
			readFile is asynch because it's slow
			
			Promises 
			
			Require #Module
			var hello = require('./hello.js');
			it's a way to namespace/modularize your code within the same scope! vars inside a file are local to that file (function scope_
			var hello = require("./hello.js');
			Node wraps every JS file
			var exports = {}
			var module.
			built in libraries - fs, http, net,
			JavaScript Scopes: function creates scopes
